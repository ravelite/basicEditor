* Welcome to the unaudicle (provisional name).

This is an open source livecoding editor with revisioning
and some UI for process-management. (in the tradition of the Audicle)

* How to build it

You will need the Qt SDK. Install this and then build the unaudicle.
(but you are on your own for this)

On Mac, Mark says you might get Qt from homebrew package system.

* How to run it

To use the unaudicle with ChucK, you will need to run the lightweight 
shell that communicates with the editor using OSC over UDP.
To do this, run oscShell.ck using the miniAudicle or command-line ChucK.

Then you should be able to use the Add Shred action from unaudicle.

* How to use it

To be written.
