unAudicle issue tracking

* BUGS
** DONE When creating new revision, old revision not preserved.
   The fix works like this:
   Before you undo the parent buffer, disconnect textChanged() signal.
   Then after you undo, you can reconnect it.
** Bugs with gridlayout when getting rid of shreds.

* Feature Ideas
** Support Supercollider.
** Make a better revision tree visualization.
*** Try implementing the ordered tree layout algorithm in trees.pdf.
** Automatically delete empty sessions.
** Save information for replaying a session.
** Make a shred action "fadeOut".
** Support File, New Buffer.
** Extend and use the macro system (maybe with arg macros)
   to support global variable declarations in chuck.
** Try to make a signals and slots way to interact with tree viz.
