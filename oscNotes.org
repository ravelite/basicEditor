* Notes on the OSC adaptors

The editor uses two-way OSC messages to communicate with the VMs running 
adaptor code: that creates new VM processes and reports results to the editor.

For now, it is assumed that the editor and VM ports are different,
thus we can use the same method names for the call and the return.

We should try to keep this updated and the language adaptors similar.

- lang :: short name for language i.e. chuck,sc

** Method calls: supported by VM adaptor

/lang/new,si: send code at path (1st arg) with coord number (2nd arg)

/lang/remove,i: remove process given by process number (arg)

** Return calls: supported by editor

/lang/new,ii: process created for coord number (1st arg) 
  if process number (2nd arg) is nonzero

/lang/remove,i: (arg) process number removed, if nonzero
